## Specific Information about this website

### Website Log Files

When you visit our websites, your browser transmits certain data to our web server for
technical reasons. The following data are recorded during an ongoing connection for
communication between your internet browser and our web server:

    - The data you entered into the input field
    - Date and time of your request
    - Name of the requested file
    - Page from which the file was requested
    - Access status (file transferred, file not found, etc.)
    - Type and version of the browser and the operating system you use
    - Full IP address of the requesting computer
    - Quantity of data transferred

For reasons of technical security, in particular to prevent attacks on our web server,
we store these data for a short period of time. User input is stored for up to one month
to provide a faster service (due to caching) and alleviate resource strain. It is
impossible to discern the identity of individual persons based on this data. After seven
days at the latest, the data is anonymized by shortening the IP address at the domain
level, so that it is no longer possible to establish any reference to the individual
user. The anonymized data will also be processed for statistical purposes. We don't
compare any data to data in other databases or forward them to third parties, even in
excerpts.

### Website analysis by Matomo

We use Matomo, a web analysis service, to optimally design our website. To evaluate and
analyze the use of our website, usage information is transmitted to our servers and stored
for analysis. Your IP address will be shortened during this process and thus anonymized.
If you want to prevent your data from being processed for data analysis purposes, you can
object at any time with a mouse click. In this case, an opt-out cookie that does not
contain any usage data is stored in your browser. As a result, Matomo will not collect any
data from your current visit to our website. Please note: If you delete cookies, this will
also delete the opt-out cookie, which you may need to reactivate.
