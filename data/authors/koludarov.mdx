Dr. Ivan Koludarov, with a broad background in theoretical and experimental biological sciences, has focused on venomics and venom evolution since 2012. His interest extends to the philosophy of science and the study of molecular evolution, particularly in how new traits and functions evolve. Currently, he is exploring the development and use of AI tools to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind protein function evolution.
