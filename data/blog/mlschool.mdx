title: "Unleash the Power of Machine Learning in Toxinology at RostLab's Winterschool"
date: '2023-08-03'
tags: ['machine-learning', 'winterschool']
draft: false
summary: 'The research team used artificial intelligence to study the evolutionary relationships of proteins, specifically focusing on the vertebrate kallikrein gene family, and found significant correlations between protein embeddings and sequence similarities. Despite testing various dimension reduction techniques, the initial protein embeddings without any reduction provided the most accurate insights into phylogenetic relationships, marking a substantial advancement in understanding life evolution and facilitating better drug development strategies.'

We're excited to announce the inaugural Winterschool for Toxinologists, brought to you by RostLab, where you will learn the intricacies of integrating Machine Learning (ML) into your toxinological research.

At RostLab, our expertise lies at the intersection of biology and machine learning.
Over the years, our team has mastered the art of curating data for machine learning and employing this data for predictive applications.
Our winterschool is designed to pass on this wealth of knowledge and experience to you!

When? The winterschool will be held from Monday, December 11, 2023, at 9:00am through to Friday, December 15, 2023, at 12:00pm.

Where? Join us at TUM Campus Garching, Boltzmannstraße 3, 85748 Garching. Get to the venue

How much? Accommodation: [Hotel Hoyacker Hof](https://www.hoyackerhof.de/en/home/). 94,00€ inklusive Business-Package / night / room.
Use the codeword you will receive upon registration.
You have to register at the Hotel by 16.10.2023. Lunch: 75,00 EUR for all the 5 days of the school.

Meet the Experts
Our winterschool is led by a team of specialists including
Burkhard Rost, one of the pioneers in bioinformatics,
Ivan Koludarov, an expert in toxin gene evolution and ML practitioner,
Tanja Krüger, specializing in predicting bacterial exotoxins using ML,
Luisa Jimenez-Soto, an expert in bacterial toxin research,
Tobias Olenyi, an expert in operationalizing ML for protein science,
and Tobias Senoner, who researches ML approaches to study toxin structure and function evolution.

What's on the Agenda?
The winterschool will guide you through the fundamentals of ML, different types of ML, preparing biological datasets for ML,
selecting and training the right model, evaluating ML models, and visualizing results.

We've designed the winterschool specifically for toxinologists and biologists who are eager to understand the basics of machine learning and integrate it into their regular workflow.
We're planning to welcome around 16 participants for a well-rounded program that balances learning with relaxation.

Do you have any questions or need more information? Don't hesitate to contact us.

So, if you're a toxinologist looking to delve into the exciting world of machine learning,
