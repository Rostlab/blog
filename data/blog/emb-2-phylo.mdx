summary: 'The research team used artificial intelligence to study the evolutionary relationships of proteins, specifically focusing on the vertebrate kallikrein gene family, and found significant correlations between protein embeddings and sequence similarities. Despite testing various dimension reduction techniques, the initial protein embeddings without any reduction provided the most accurate insights into phylogenetic relationships, marking a substantial advancement in understanding life evolution and facilitating better drug development strategies.'

# Introduction

Markdown and Mdx parsing is supported via `unified`, and other remark and rehype packages. `next-mdx-remote` allows us to parse `.mdx` and `.md` files in a more flexible manner without touching webpack.

GitHub flavored markdown is used. `mdx-prism` provides syntax highlighting capabilities for code blocks. Here's a demo of how everything looks.

The following markdown cheatsheet is adapted from: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/
